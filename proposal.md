## Proposed Project

> I plan on creating an application that will facilitate playing
> the game Dungeons and Dragons. The application will store information
> regarding characters and allow the user to perform "skill checks" which
> is essentially a function that takes in the character's relevant skill,
> the difficulty of the task, and a random number between 1 and 20, returning
> true or false. 

## Outline Structure

> The application will be structured as a supervised set of two applications.
> One will act as a cache, being a map containing maps describing character
> stats (strength, charisma, any bonuses, etc.) and the other will use a
> random number generator combined with the user's input to determine if a
> skill check succeeds or fails. On opening, the application will pull character
> data from a .txt file, and on normal termination, the cache will be saved to
> that same file.
